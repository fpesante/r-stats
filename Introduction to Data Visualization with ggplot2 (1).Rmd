# Introduction to Data Visualization with ggplot2

## Course Description
The ability to produce meaningful and beautiful data visualizations is an essential part of your skill set as a data scientist. This course, the first R data visualization tutorial in the series, introduces you to the principles of good visualizations and the grammar of graphics plotting concepts implemented in the ggplot2 package. ggplot2 has become the go-to tool for flexible and professional plots in R. Here, we’ll examine the first three essential layers for making a plot - Data, Aesthetics and Geometries. By the end of the course you will be able to make complex exploratory plots. 

## INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we’ll get you into the right frame of mind for developing meaningful visualizations with R. You’ll understand that as a communications tool, visualizations require you to think about your audience first. You’ll also be introduced to the basics of ggplot2 - the 7 different grammatical elements (layers) and aesthetic mappings. 

### Exploratory versus explanatory
It's important to understand the distinction between **exploratory** and **explanatory** visualizations. **Exploratory visualizations** are easily-generated, data-heavy and intended for a small specialist audience, for example yourself and your colleagues - their primary purpose is graphical data analysis. **Explanatory visualizations** are labor-intensive, data-specific and intended for a broader audience, e.g. in publications or presentations - they are part of the communications process.

**SCATTER PLOT**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
data(mammals)
ggplot(mammals, aes(x = body, y = brain)) +
  geom_point()
```
**LINEAR MODEL**
```{r}
ggplot(mammals, aes(x = body, y = brain)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  stat_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    color = "red",
    se = FALSE
  )
```
**LINEAR MODEL (FINE-TUNING)**
```{r}
ggplot(mammals, aes(x = body, y = brain)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  stat_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    color = "#C42126",
    se = FALSE,
    size = 1
  )
```

### Exercise 01
**Drawing your first plot**
To get a first feel for ggplot2, let's try to run some basic ggplot2 commands. The mtcars dataset contains information on 32 cars from a 1973 issue of Motor Trend magazine. This dataset is small, intuitive, and contains a variety of continuous and categorical variables.
**Instructions**
+ Load the ggplot2 package using library().
+ Use str() to explore the structure of the mtcars dataset.
```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Explore the mtcars data frame with str()
str(mtcars)

# Execute the following command
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```
### Exercise 02
**Data columns types affect plot types**
The plot from the previous exercise wasn't really satisfying. Although cyl (the number of cylinders) is categorical, you probably noticed that it is classified as numeric in mtcars. This is really misleading because the representation in the plot doesn't match the actual data type. You'll have to explicitly tell ggplot2 that cyl is a categorical variable.
**Instructions**
+ Change the ggplot() command by wrapping factor() around cyl.
```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Change the command below so that cyl is treated as factor
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Exercise 03
**Mapping data columns to aesthetics**
Let's dive a little deeper into the three main topics in this course: The data, aesthetics, and geom layers. We'll get to making pretty plots in the last chapter with the themes layer.

We'll continue working on the 32 cars in the mtcars data frame.

Consider how the examples and concepts we discuss throughout these courses apply to your own data-sets!
**Instructions**
+ Add a color aesthetic mapped to the displacement of the car engine: inside aes(), add a color argument equal to disp.
+ This time, map disp to the size aesthetic
```{r}
# Change the color aesthetic to a size aesthetic
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = disp)) +
  geom_point()

# Change the color aesthetic to a size aesthetic
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = disp, size = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Understanding variables**
In the previous exercise you saw that disp can be mapped onto a color gradient or onto a continuous size scale.

Another argument of aes() is the shape of the points. There are a finite number of shapes which ggplot() can automatically assign to the points. However, if you try this command in the console:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, shape = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```
It gives an error. What does this mean? The error message 'A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape', means that shape doesn't exist on a continuous scale here. 

## ggplot2 layers
There are two key functions that ggplot2 serves:
1. We construct plots by layering grammatical elements on top of each other. 
2. We use aesthetic mappings to bridge the link between data and it's visual interpretation. 
**Aesthetics and Geometries**
```{r}
data(iris)
g <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))+
  geom_jitter()
```
**Themes**
```{r}
g <- g + 
  labs(x = "Sepal Length (cm)", y = "Sepal Width (cm)") + 
  theme_classic()
g  
```
### Exercise 04
**Adding geometries**
The diamonds dataset contains details of 1,000 diamonds. Among the variables included are carat (a measurement of the diamond's size) and price.

You'll use two common geom layer functions:
+ **geom_point()** adds points (as in a scatter plot).
+ **geom_smooth()** adds a smooth trend curve.

As you saw previously, these are added using the + operator.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_*()
```
Where * is the specific geometry needed.

**Instructions**
1. Explore the diamonds data frame with the str() function.
2. Edit the plot code to add a point geom. Use the + operator to add geom_point() to the ggplot() command.
3. Add a smooth geom to the plot. Use the + operator to add geom_smooth().
```{r}
str(diamonds)
# Add geom_smooth() with +
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
### Exercise 05
**Changing one geom or every geom**
If you have multiple geoms, then mapping an aesthetic to data variable inside the call to ggplot() will change all the geoms. It is also possible to make changes to individual geoms by passing arguments to the geom_*() functions.

geom_point() has an alpha argument that controls the opacity of the points. A value of 1 (the default) means that the points are totally opaque; a value of 0 means the points are totally transparent (and therefore invisible). Values in between specify transparency.

The plot you drew last time is provided in the script.
**Instructions**
1. Edit the plot code to map the color aesthetic to the clarity data variable.

```{r}
# Map the color aesthetic to clarity
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth()
```
### Exercise 06
**Saving plots as variables**
Plots can be saved as variables, which can be added to later on using the + operator. This is really useful if you want to make multiple related plots from a common base.
**Instructions**
+ Using the diamonds dataset, plot the price (y-axis) versus the carat (x-axis), assigning to plt_price_vs_carat.
+ Using geom_point(), add a point layer to plt_price_vs_carat.
```{r}
plt_price_vs_carat <- ggplot(
  # Use the diamonds dataset
  diamonds,
  # For the aesthetics, map x to carat and y to price
  aes(carat,price)
) +

# Add a point layer to plt_price_vs_carat
 geom_point() +
 geom_smooth()
```
+ Add an alpha argument to the point layer to make the points 20% opaque, assigning to plt_price_vs_carat_transparent.
+ Type the plot's variable name (plt_price_vs_carat_transparent) to display it.
 %>% 
```{r}
# From previous step
plt_price_vs_carat <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))

# Edit this to map color to clarity,
# Assign the updated plot to a new object
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity <- plt_price_vs_carat + geom_point(aes(color = clarity))

# See the plot
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity
```

## VISIBLE AESTHETICS

```{r, mapping onto x and y axes}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))+
  geom_point()
```

```{r, mapping into color}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species))+
  geom_point()
```

[Typical visible aesthetics](C:/Users/francisco.pesante/Documents/2023/04-recursos-humanos/datacamp/typical-visible-aesthetics.png)

## All about aesthetics: color, shape and size

In the video you saw 9 visible aesthetics. Let's apply them to a categorical variable — the cylinders in mtcars, cyl.

These are the aesthetics you can consider within aes() in this chapter: x, y, color, fill, size, alpha, labels and shape.

One common convention is that you don't name the x and y arguments to aes(), since they almost always come first, but you do name other arguments.

In the following exercise the fcyl column is categorical. It is cyl transformed into a factor.

**Instructions 4/4**

Map mpg onto the x aesthetic, and fcyl onto the y.

Swap the mappings of the first plot: fcyl onto the x aesthetic, and mpg onto the y.

Map wt onto x, mpg onto y, and fcyl onto color.

Modify the point layer of the previous plot by changing the shape argument to 1 and increasing the size to 4.

```{r}
# Map x to wt, y to mpg and color to fcyl
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = fcyl)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = fcyl)) +
  # Set the shape and size of the points
  geom_point(shape = 1, size = 4)
```

### Exercise 07
**All about aesthetics: color vs. fill**
Typically, the **color** aesthetic changes the *outline* of a geom and the **fill** aesthetic changes the inside. **geom_point()** is an exception: you use **color** (not **fill**) for the point color. However, some shapes have special behavior.

The default **geom_point()** uses **shape = 19**: a solid circle. An alternative is **shape = 21**: a circle that allow you to use both **fill** for the inside and **color** for the outline. This is lets you to map two aesthetics to each point.

All shape values are described on the points() help page.

**fcyl** and **fam** are the **cyl** and **am** columns converted to factors, respectively.

Instructions 1/3

1. Change the aesthetics so that **fcyl** maps to **fill** rather than **color**.
```{r}
# Map fcyl to fill
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, fill = fcyl)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1, size = 4)
```
2. In geom_point() change the shape argument to 21 and add an alpha argument set to 0.6.
3. In the ggplot() aesthetics, map fam to color.
```{r}
# Map color to fam
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = fam, fill = fcyl)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 4, alpha = 0.6)
```
### Exercise 08
**All about aesthetics: comparing aesthetics**
Now that you've got some practice with using attributes, be careful of a major pitfall: these attributes can overwrite the aesthetics of your plot!

**Instructions 1/4**
1. Using mtcars, create a plot base layer, plt_mpg_vs_wt. Map mpg onto y and wt onto x.
Add a point layer, mapping the categorical no. of cylinders, fcyl, onto size.
```{r}
# Establish the base layer
plt_mpg_vs_wt <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))

# Map fcyl to size
plt_mpg_vs_wt +
  geom_point(aes(size = fcyl))
```
2. Change the mapping. This time fcyl should be mapped onto alpha.
```{r}
# Base layer
plt_mpg_vs_wt <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))

# Map fcyl to shape, not alpha
plt_mpg_vs_wt +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = fcyl))
```
3. Change the mapping again. This time fcyl should be mapped onto shape.
```{r}
# Base layer
plt_mpg_vs_wt <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))

# Map fcyl to shape, not alpha
plt_mpg_vs_wt +
  geom_point(aes(shape = fcyl))
```
4. Swap the geom layer: change points to text. Change the mapping again. This time fcyl should be mapped onto label.
```{r}
# Base layer
plt_mpg_vs_wt <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))

# Use text layer and map fcyl to label
plt_mpg_vs_wt +
  geom_text(aes(label = fcyl))
```

**Aesthetics for categorical & continuous variables**
Many of the aesthetics can accept either continuous or categorical variables, but some are restricted to categorical data. Which aesthetics are only applicable to categorical data?

Answer the question: label & shape.

## USING ATTRIBUTES
Way something look. Different from aesthetics.

### Exercise
**All about attributes: color, shape, size and alpha**
This time you'll use these arguments to set attributes of the plot, not map variables onto aesthetics.

You can specify colors in R using hex codes: a hash followed by two hexadecimal numbers each for red, green, and blue ("#RRGGBB"). Hexadecimal is base-16 counting. You have 0 to 9, and A representing 10 up to F representing 15. Pairs of hexadecimal numbers give you a range from 0 to 255. "#000000" is "black" (no color), "#FFFFFF" means "white", and `"#00FFFF" is cyan (mixed green and blue).

A hexadecimal color variable, my_blue has been defined for you.
Set the point color to my_blue and the alpha to 0.6.
```{r}
# A hexadecimal color
my_blue <- "#4ABEFF"

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  # Set the point color and alpha
  geom_point(color = my_blue, alpha = 0.6)
```

Change the color mapping to a fill mapping. That is, fcyl should be mapped onto fill.
Set the color of the points to my_blue, point size to 10 and the point shape to 1.
```{r}
# A hexadecimal color
my_blue <- "#4ABEFF"

# Change the color mapping to a fill mapping
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = fill)) +
  # Set point size and shape
  geom_point(color = my_blue, size = 10, shape = 1)
```


## OVERPLOTTING 1: LARGE DATASES

### Exercise

Scatter plots (using geom_point()) are intuitive, easily understood, and very common, but we must always consider overplotting, particularly in the following four situations:

+ Large datasets

+ Aligned values on a single axis

+ Low-precision data

+ Integer data

Typically, alpha blending (i.e. adding transparency) is recommended when using solid shapes. Alternatively, you can use opaque, hollow shapes.

Small points are suitable for large datasets with regions of high density (lots of overlapping).

Let's use the diamonds dataset to practice dealing with the large dataset case.

**Instructions 2/2**
1. Add a points layer to the base plot.

2. Set the point transparency to 0.5.

3. Set shape = ".", the point size of 1 pixel.
```{r}
# Plot price vs. carat, colored by clarity
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity))

# Set transparency to 0.5
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, shape = ".")
```
4. Update the point shape to remove the line outlines by setting shape to 16.
```{r}
# Plot price vs. carat, colored by clarity
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity))

# Set transparency to 0.5
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, shape = "16")
```

## OVERPLOTTING 2: ALIGNED VALUES

### Exercise

Let's take a look at another case where we should be aware of overplotting: Aligning values on a single axis.

This occurs when one axis is continuous and the other is categorical, which can be overcome with some form of jittering.

In the mtcars data set, fam and fcyl are categorical variants of cyl and am.

**Instructions**

1. Create a base plot plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam of fcyl by mpg, colored by fam. Add a points layer to the base plot.

```{r}
# Plot base
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, mpg, color = fam))

# Default points are shown for comparison
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point()
```

2. Add some jittering by using position_jitter(), setting the width to 0.3.
```{r}
# Plot base
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, mpg, color = fam))

# Default points are shown for comparison
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point()

# Alter the point positions by jittering, width 0.3
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point(position = position_jitter(0.3))
```

3. Alternatively, use position_jitterdodge(). Set jitter.width and dodge.width to 0.3 to separate subgroups further.
```{r}
# Plot base
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, mpg, color = fam))

# Default points are shown for comparison
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point()

# Now jitter and dodge the point positions
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.3, dodge.width = 0.3))
```


## OVERPLOTTNG 3: LOW PRECISION-DATA

You already saw how to deal with overplotting when using geom_point() in two cases:

1. Large datasets

2. Aligned values on a single axis

We used position = 'jitter' inside geom_point() or geom_jitter().

Let's take a look at another case:

1. Low-precision data

This results from low-resolution measurements like in the iris dataset, which is measured to 1mm precision (see viewer). It's similar to case 2, but in this case we can jitter on both the x and y axis.

**Instructions**

1. Change the points layer into a jitter layer. Reduce the jitter layer's width by setting the width argument to 0.1.
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  # Swap for jitter layer with width 0.1
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.1)
```

2. Let's use a different approach: Within geom_point(), set position to "jitter".
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  # Set the position to jitter
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.5)
```

3. Provide an alternative specification: Have the position argument call position_jitter() with a width of 0.1.
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  # Use a jitter position function with width 0.1
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(0.1))
```

## OVERPLOTTING 4: INTEGER DATA
Let's take a look at the last case of dealing with overplotting:

1. Integer data

This can be type integer (i.e. 1 ,2, 3…) or categorical (i.e. class factor) variables. factor is just a special class of type integer.

You'll typically have a small, defined number of intersections between two variables, which is similar to case 3, but you may miss it if you don't realize that integer and factor data are the same as low precision data.

The Vocab dataset provided contains the years of education and vocabulary test scores from respondents to US General Social Surveys from 1972-2004.

**Instructions**

1. Examine the Vocab dataset using str(). Using Vocab, draw a plot of vocabulary vs education. Add a point layer.
```{r}
# Examine the structure of Vocab
str(Vocab)

# Plot vocabulary vs. education
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education,vocabulary)) +
  # Add a point layer
  geom_point()
```

2. Replace the point layer with a jitter layer.
```{r}
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, vocabulary)) +
  # Change to a jitter layer
  geom_jitter()
```

3. Set the jitter transparency to 0.2.
```{r}
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, vocabulary)) +
  # Change to a jitter layer
  geom_jitter(alpha =0.2)
```

4. Set the shape of the jittered points to hollow circles, (shape 1).
```{r}
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, vocabulary)) +
  # Change to a jitter layer
  geom_jitter(alpha =0.2, shape = 1)
```

## HISTOGRAMS

### Drawing histograms

Recall that histograms cut up a continuous variable into discrete bins and, by default, maps the internally calculated count variable (the number of observations in each bin) onto the y aesthetic. An internal variable called density can be accessed by using the .. notation, i.e. ..density... Plotting this variable will show the relative frequency, which is the height times the width of each bin.

**Instructions**
1. Using mtcars, map mpg onto the x aesthetic. Add a histogram layer using geom_histogram().
```{r}
# Plot mpg
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg)) +
  # Add a histogram layer
  geom_histogram()
```

2. Set the histogram binwidth to 1.
```{r}
# Plot mpg
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg)) +
  # Add a histogram layer
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

3. Map y to the internal variable ..density.. to show frequency densities.
```{r}
# Map y to ..density..
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

4. Set the fill color of the histogram bars to datacamp_light_blue.
```{r}
datacamp_light_blue <- "#51A8C9"

ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, ..density..)) +
  # Set the fill color to datacamp_light_blue
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = datacamp_light_blue)
```

### Positions in histograms
Here, we'll examine the various ways of applying positions to histograms. geom_histogram(), a special case of geom_bar(), has a position argument that can take on the following values:

+ stack (the default): Bars for different groups are stacked on top of each other.

+ dodge: Bars for different groups are placed side by side.

+ fill: Bars for different groups are shown as proportions.

+ identity: Plot the values as they appear in the dataset.

**Instructions**

1. Update the aesthetics so that the fill color of the bars is determined by fam.
```{r}
# Update the aesthetics so the fill color is by fam
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, fill = fam)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

2. Update the histogram layer to position the bars side-by-side, that is, "dodge".
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, fill = fam)) +
  # Change the position to dodge
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "dodge")
```

3. Update the histogram layer so the bars' positions "fill" the y-axis.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg,fill = fam)) +
  # Change the position to fill
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "fill")
```

4. Update the histogram layer so bars are top of each other, using the "identity" position. So each bar can be seen, set alpha to 0.4.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, fill = fam)) +
  # Change the position to identity, with transparency 0.4
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "identity", alpha = 0.4)
```

## BARPLOTS

### Position in bar and col plots

Let's see how the position argument changes geom_bar().

We have three position options:

+ stack: The default

+ dodge: Preferred

+ fill: To show proportions

While we will be using geom_bar() here, note that the function geom_col() is just geom_bar() where both the position and stat arguments are set to "identity". It is used when we want the heights of the bars to represent the exact values in the data.

In this exercise, you'll draw the total count of cars having a given number of cylinders (fcyl), according to manual or automatic transmission type (fam).

**Instructions**

1. Using mtcars, plot fcyl, filled by fam. Add a bar layer using geom_bar().
```{r}
# Plot fcyl, filled by fam
ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Add a bar layer
  geom_bar()
```

2. Set the bar position argument to "fill".
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Set the position to "fill"
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

3. Change the bar position argument to "dodge".
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Change the position to "dodge"
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

### Overlapping bar plots

You can customize bar plots further by adjusting the dodging so that your bars partially overlap each other. Instead of using position = "dodge", you're going to use position_dodge(), like you did with position_jitter() in the the previous exercises. Here, you'll save this as an object, posn_d, so that you can easily reuse it.

Remember, the reason you want to use position_dodge() (and position_jitter()) is to specify how much dodging (or jittering) you want.

For this example, you'll use the mtcars dataset.

**Instructions**
1. Use the functional form of the bar position: replace "dodge" with a call to position_dodge(). Set its width to 0.2.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Set the transparency to 0.6
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(width = 0.2))
```

2. Set the bar transparency level of the bars to 0.6.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Set the transparency to 0.6
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(width = 0.2), alpha = 0.6)
```

### Bar plots: sequential color palette

In this bar plot, we'll fill each segment according to an ordinal variable. The best way to do that is with a sequential color palette.

Here's an example of using a sequential color palette with the mtcars dataset:

ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

In the exercise, you'll use similar code on the the Vocab dataset. Both datasets are ordinal.

**Instructions**
1. Plot the Vocab dataset, mapping education onto x and vocabulary onto fill.
```{r}
# Plot education, filled by vocabulary
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, fill = vocabulary)) +
  geom_bar() 
```

2. Add a bar layer, setting position to "fill".
```{r}
# Plot education, filled by vocabulary
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, fill = vocabulary)) +
  # Add a bar layer with position "fill"
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

3. Add a brewer fill scale, using the default palette (don't pass any arguments). Notice how this generates a warning message and an incomplete plot.
```{r}
# Plot education, filled by vocabulary
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, fill = vocabulary)) +
  # Add a bar layer with position "fill"
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  # Add a brewer fill scale with default palette
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

## LINE PLOTS

### Basic line plots

Here, we'll use the economics dataset to make some line plots. The dataset contains a time series for unemployment and population statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in the United States. The data is contained in the ggplot2 package.

To begin with, you can look at how the median unemployment time and the unemployment rate (the number of unemployed people as a proportion of the population) change over time.

**Instructions**
1. Print the head of the economics dataset. Plot unemploy vs. date as a line plot.
```{r}
# Print the head of economics
head(economics)

# Using economics, plot unemploy vs. date
ggplot(economics, aes(date,unemploy)) +
  # Make it a line plot
  geom_line()
```

2. Adjust the y-axis aesthetic of the plot so that it represents the proportion of the population that is unemployed.
```{r}
# Change the y-axis to the proportion of the population that is unemployed
ggplot(economics, aes(date,unemploy/pop)) +
  geom_line()
```

### Multiple time series

We already saw how the form of your data affects how you can plot it. Let's explore that further with multiple time series. Here, it's important that all lines are on the same scale, and if possible, on the same plot.

fish.species contains the global capture rates of seven salmon species from 1950–2010. Each variable (column) is a Salmon species and each observation (row) is one year. fish.tidy contains the same data, but in three columns: Species, Year, and Capture (i.e. one variable per column).

**Instructions**
1. Use str() in the console to examine the structure of both fish.species and fish.tidy. Plot only the Rainbow salmon time series with geom_line().
```{r}
# Plot the Rainbow Salmon time series
ggplot(fish.species, aes(x = Year, y = Rainbow)) +
  geom_line()
```

2. Plot only the Rainbow salmon time series with geom_line().
```{r}
# Plot the Pink Salmon time series
ggplot(fish.species, aes(Year,Pink)) +
  geom_line()
```

3. Now try and plot all time series in a single plot.

+ Plot the fish.tidy dataset, mapping Year to x and Capture to y.

+ group by fish species within the aesthetics of geom_line().
```{r}
# Plot multiple time-series by grouping by species
ggplot(fish.tidy, aes(Year, Capture)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Species))
```

4. Let's add color to the previous plot to distinguish between the different time series.

+ Plot the fish.tidy dataset again, this time making sure to color by Species.
```{r}
# Plot multiple time-series by coloring by species
ggplot(fish.tidy, aes(x = Year, y = Capture, color = Species)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Species))
```

# THEMES

In this chapter, we’ll explore how understanding the structure of your data makes data visualization much easier. Plus, it’s time to make our plots pretty. This is the last step in the data viz process. The Themes layer will enable you to make publication quality plots directly in R. In the next course we'll look at some extra layers to add more variables to your plots.

## Moving the legend

Let's wrap up this course by making a publication-ready plot communicating a clear message.

To change stylistic elements of a plot, call theme() and set plot properties to a new value. For example, the following changes the legend position.

  p + theme(legend.position = new_value)

Here, the new value can be

+ "top", "bottom", "left", or "right'": place it at that side of the plot.

+ "none": don't draw it.

+ c(x, y): c(0, 0) means the bottom-left and c(1, 1) means the top-right.

Let's revisit the recession period line plot (assigned to plt_prop_unemployed_over_time).

**Instructions**

1. Update the plot to remove the legend.
Look at the changes in the plot.
```{r}
# View the default plot
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time

# Remove legend entirely
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

2. Update the plot to position the legend at the bottom of the plot. Look at the changes in the plot.
```{r}
# Position the legend at the bottom of the plot
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

3. Position the legend inside the plot, with x-position 0.6 and y-position 0.1. Look at the changes in the plot.
```{r}
# Position the legend inside the plot at (0.6, 0.1)
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.6, 0.1))
```

## Modifying theme elements

Many plot elements have multiple properties that can be set. For example, line elements in the plot such as axes and gridlines have a color, a thickness (size), and a line type (solid line, dashed, or dotted). To set the style of a line, you use element_line(). For example, to make the axis lines into red, dashed lines, you would use the following.

p + theme(axis.line = element_line(color = "red", linetype = "dashed"))

Similarly, element_rect() changes rectangles and element_text() changes text. You can remove a plot element using element_blank().

plt_prop_unemployed_over_time is available.

**Instructions**

1. Give all rectangles in the plot, (the rect element) a fill color of "grey92" (very pale grey).

+ Remove the legend.key's outline by setting its color to be missing.

+ Look at the changes in the plot.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(
    # For all rectangles, set the fill color to grey92
    rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
    # For the legend key, turn off the outline
    legend.key = element_rect(color = NA))
```

2. Remove the axis ticks, axis.ticks by making them a blank element.

+ Remove the panel gridlines, panel.grid in the same way.

+ Look at the changes in the plot.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(
    rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
    legend.key = element_rect(color = NA),
    # Turn off axis ticks
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    # Turn off the panel grid
  panel.grid = element_blank()  
  )
```

3. Add the major horizontal grid lines back to the plot using panel.grid.major.y.

+ Set the line color to "white", size to 0.5, and linetype to "dotted".

+ Look at the changes in the plot.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(
    rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
    legend.key = element_rect(color = NA),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # Add major y-axis panel grid lines back
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(
      # Set the color to white
      color = "white",
      # Set the size to 0.5
      size = 0.5,
      # Set the line type to dotted
      linetype = "dotted"
    )
  )
```

4. Make the axis tick labels' text, axis.text, less prominent by changing the color to "grey25".

+ Increase the plot.title's, size to 16 and change its font face to "italic".

+ Look at the changes in the plot.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(
    rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
    legend.key = element_rect(color = NA),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(
      color = "white",
      size = 0.5,
      linetype = "dotted"
    ),
    # Set the axis text color to grey25
    axis.text = element_text(color = "grey25"),
    # Set the plot title font face to italic and font size to 16
   plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= "italic")
  )
```

## Modifying whitespace

Whitespace means all the non-visible margins and spacing in the plot.

To set a single whitespace value, use unit(x, unit), where x is the amount and unit is the unit of measure.

Borders require you to set 4 positions, so use margin(top, right, bottom, left, unit). To remember the margin order, think TRouBLe.

The default unit is "pt" (points), which scales well with text. Other options include "cm", "in" (inches) and "lines" (of text).

plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl is available. The panel and legend are wrapped in blue boxes so you can see how they change.

**Instructions**

1. Give the axis tick length, axis.ticks.length, a unit of 2 "lines".
```{r}
# View the original plot
plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl

plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl +
  theme(
    # Set the axis tick length to 2 lines
    axis.ticks.length = unit(2, "lines")
  )
```

2. Give the legend key size, legend.key.size, a unit of 3 centimeters ("cm").
```{r}
plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl +
  theme(
    # Set the legend key size to 3 centimeters
    legend.key.size = unit(3,"cm")
  )
```

3. Set the legend.margin to 20 points ("pt") on the top, 30 pts on the right, 40 pts on the bottom, and 50 pts on the left.
```{r}
plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl +
  theme(
    # Set the legend margin to (20, 30, 40, 50) points
    legend.margin = margin(20,30,40,50,"pt"))
```

4. Set the plot margin, plot.margin, to 10, 30, 50, and 70 millimeters ("mm").
```{r}
plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl +
  theme(
    # Set the plot margin to (10, 30, 50, 70) millimeters
    plot.margin = margin(10,30,50,70,"mm")
  )
```

## Built-in themes

In addition to making your own themes, there are several out-of-the-box solutions that may save you lots of time.

+ theme_gray() is the default.

+ theme_bw() is useful when you use transparency.

+ theme_classic() is more traditional.

+ theme_void() removes everything but the data.

**Instructions**

1. Add a black and white theme, theme_bw(), to the plot.
What changed in the plot?
```{r}
# Add a black and white theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_bw()
```

2. Add a classic theme, theme_classic(), to the plot.
What changed in the plot?
```{r}
# Add a classic theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_classic()
```

3. Add a void theme, theme_void(), to the plot.
What changed in the plot?
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time is available.
```{r}
# Add a void theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_void()
```

## Exploring ggthemes

Outside of ggplot2, another source of built-in themes is the ggthemes package. The workspace already contains the plt_prop_unemployed_over_time, the line plot from before. Let's explore some of the ready-made ggthemes themes.

plt_prop_unemployed_over_time is available.

**Instructions* 1/3**

1. Add a fivethirtyeight.com theme, theme_fivethirtyeight(), to the plot.
What changed in the plot?
```{r}
# Use the fivethirtyeight theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

2. Add an Edward Tufte theme, theme_tufte(), to the plot.
What changed in the plot?
```{r}
# Use Tufte's theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_tufte()
```

3. Add a Wall Street Journal theme, theme_wsj(), to the plot.
What changed in the plot?
```{r}
# Use the Wall Street Journal theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_wsj()
```

## Setting themes

Reusing a theme across many plots helps to provide a consistent style. You have several options for this.

1. Assign the theme to a variable, and add it to each plot.

2. Set your theme as the default using theme_set().

A good strategy that you'll use here is to begin with a built-in theme then modify it.

plt_prop_unemployed_over_time is available. The theme you made earlier is shown in the sample code.

**Instructions**

1.Assign the theme to theme_recession.

+ Add the Tufte theme and theme_recession together.

Use the Tufte recession theme by adding it to the plot.
```{r}
# Save the theme as theme_recession
heme_recession <- theme(
  rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
  legend.key = element_rect(color = NA),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  panel.grid = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "white", size = 0.5, linetype = "dotted"),
  axis.text = element_text(color = "grey25"),
  plot.title = element_text(face = "italic", size = 16),
  legend.position = c(0.6, 0.1)
)

# Combine the Tufte theme with theme_recession
theme_tufte_recession <- theme_tufte() + theme_recession

# Add the Tufte recession theme to the plot
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time + theme_tufte_recession
```

2. Use theme_set() to set theme_tufte_recession as the default theme.

+ Draw the plot, plt_prop_unemployed_over_time, without explicitly adding a theme.

+ Look at the plot. Was it styled with the default theme or the new theme?*
```{r}
theme_recession <- theme(
  rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
  legend.key = element_rect(color = NA),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  panel.grid = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "white", size = 0.5, linetype = "dotted"),
  axis.text = element_text(color = "grey25"),
  plot.title = element_text(face = "italic", size = 16),
  legend.position = c(0.6, 0.1)
)
theme_tufte_recession <- theme_tufte() + theme_recession

# Set theme_tufte_recession as the default theme
theme_set(theme_tufte_recession)

# Draw the plot (without explicitly adding a theme)
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time
```

## Publication-quality plots

We've seen many examples of beautiful, publication-quality plots. Let's take a final look and put all the pieces together.

plt_prop_unemployed_over_time is available.

**Instructions**

1. Add Tufte's theme.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  # Add Tufte's theme
  theme_tufte()
```

2. Call the function to add individual theme elements. Turn off the legend and the axis ticks.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_tufte() +
  # Add individual theme elements
  theme(
    # Turn off the legend
    legend.position = "none",
    # Turn off the axis ticks
    axis.ticks = element_blank()
  )
```

3. Set the axis title and axis text's text color to grey60.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_tufte() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    # Set the axis title's text color to grey60
    axis.title = element_text(color = "grey60"),
    # Set the axis text's text color to grey60
    axis.text = element_text(color = "grey60")
  )
```

4. Set the panel gridlines major y values. Set the color to grey60, the size to 0.25, and the line type to dotted.
```{r}
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_tufte() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "grey60"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "grey60"),
    # Set the panel gridlines major y values
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(
      # Set the color to grey60
      color = "grey60",
      # Set the size to 0.25
      size = 0.25,
      # Set the linetype to dotted
      linetype = "dotted"
    )
  )
```

## Using geoms for explanatory plots

Let's focus on producing beautiful and effective explanatory plots. In the next couple of exercises, you'll create a plot that is similar to the one shown in the video using gm2007, a filtered subset of the gapminder dataset.

This type of plot will be in an info-viz style, meaning that it would be similar to something you'd see in a magazine or website for a mostly lay audience.

A scatterplot of lifeExp by country, colored by lifeExp, with points of size 4, is provided.

**Instructions**

1. geom_segment() adds line segments and requires two additional aesthetics: xend and yend. To draw a horizontal line for each point, map 30 onto xend and country onto yend.
```{r}
# Add a geom_segment() layer
ggplot(gm2007, aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, color = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 30, yend = country), size = 2)
```

2. geom_text also needs an additional aesthetic: label. Map lifeExp onto label, and set the attributes color to "white" and size to 1.5.
```{r}
# Add a geom_text() layer
ggplot(gm2007, aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, color = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 30, yend = country), size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = lifeExp), color = "white", size = 1.5)
```

3. The color scale has been set for you, but you need to clean up the scales. For the x scale:

+ Set expand to c(0, 0) and limits to c(30, 90).

+ Place the axis on the top of the plot with the position argument.
```{r}
# Set the color scale
palette <- brewer.pal(5, "RdYlBu")[-(2:4)]

# Modify the scales
ggplot(gm2007, aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, color = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 30, yend = country), size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(lifeExp,1)), color = "white", size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous("", expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(30, 90), position = "top") +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = palette)
```

4. Make sure to label the plot appropriately using labs():

+ Make the title "Highest and lowest life expectancies, 2007".

+ Add a reference by setting caption to "Source: gapminder".
```{r}
# Set the color scale
palette <- brewer.pal(5, "RdYlBu")[-(2:4)]

# Add a title and caption
ggplot(gm2007, aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, color = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 30, yend = country), size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(lifeExp,1)), color = "white", size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous("", expand = c(0,0), limits = c(30,90), position = "top") +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = palette) +
  labs(title = "Highest and lowest life expectancies, 2007", caption = "Source: gapminder")
```

## Using annotate() for embellishments
In the previous exercise, we completed our basic plot. Now let's polish it by playing with the theme and adding annotations. In this exercise, you'll use annotate() to add text and a curve to the plot.

The following values have been calculated for you to assist with adding embellishments to the plot:

global_mean <- mean(gm2007_full$lifeExp)
x_start <- global_mean + 4
y_start <- 5.5
x_end <- global_mean
y_end <- 7.5

Our previous plot has been assigned to plt_country_vs_lifeExp.

**Instructions**

1. Clean up the theme:

+ Add a classic theme to the plot with theme_classic().

+ Set axis.line.y, axis.ticks.y, and axis.title to element_blank().

+ Set the axis.text color to "black".

+ Remove the legend by setting legend.position to "none".
```{r}
# Define the theme
plt_country_vs_lifeExp +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")
```

2. Use geom_vline() to add a vertical line. Set xintercept to global_mean, specify the color to be "grey40", and set linetype to 3.
```{r}
# Add a vertical line
plt_country_vs_lifeExp +
  step_1_themes +
  geom_vline(xintercept = global_mean, color = "grey40", linetype = 3)
```

3. x_start and y_start will be used as positions to place text and have been calculated for you.

+ Add a "text" geom as an annotation.

+ For the annotation, set x to x_start, y to y_start, and label to "The\nglobal\naverage".
```{r}
# Add text
plt_country_vs_lifeExp +
  step_1_themes +
  geom_vline(xintercept = global_mean, color = "grey40", linetype = 3) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    x = x_start, y = y_start,
    label = "The\nglobal\naverage",
    vjust = 1, size = 3, color = "grey40"
  )
```

4. Annotate the plot with an arrow connecting your text to the line.

+ Use a "curve" geom.

+ Set the arrow ends xend to x_end and yend to y_end.

+ Set the length of the arrowhead to 0.2 cm and the type to "closed".
```{r}
# Add a curve
plt_country_vs_lifeExp +  
  step_1_themes +
  geom_vline(xintercept = global_mean, color = "grey40", linetype = 3) +
  step_3_annotation +
  annotate(
    "curve",
    x = x_start, y = y_start,
    xend = x_end, yend = y_end,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"), type = "closed"),
    color = "grey40"
  )
```
